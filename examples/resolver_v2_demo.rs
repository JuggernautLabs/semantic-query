//! Demonstration of QueryResolver V2 improvements over V1
//!
//! This example shows how V2 handles mixed content (text + structured data) 
//! more gracefully than V1, which assumes the entire response is parseable as T.

I'll analyze the Rust async ecosystem for you. Let me break this down systematically.

The async landscape in Rust has evolved significantly. Here's my analysis:

{
  "topic": "Rust Async Ecosystem",
  "key_points": [
    "Tokio dominates the runtime space",
    "async/await syntax is stable and mature",
    "Pin and Future traits are core abstractions"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.92
}

Additionally, I should mention that there are alternative runtimes worth considering:

{
  "topic": "Alternative Runtimes",
  "key_points": [
    "async-std provides stdlib-like APIs",
    "smol is lightweight and simple",
    "Embassy targets embedded systems"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.85
}

This covers the main landscape. The ecosystem is quite mature now, with tokio being the most widely adopted solution for most use cases.
